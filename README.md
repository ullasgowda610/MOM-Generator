# MOM Generator
 This project is an AI-based application designed to automatically generate Minutes of Meeting (MoM) from various data sources such as PDF, DOCX, and image files.
 It leverages Google Generative AI, Streamlit, and custom-built functions to extract and analyze information effectively.
 Using prompt engineering techniques, the model is guided to interpret unstructured text and provide a structured summary in the form of detailed meeting minutes. 
 The objective of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be applied to real-world scenarios by simplifying the process of capturing and documenting key information from different formats.
